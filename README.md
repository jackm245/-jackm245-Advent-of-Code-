## About this repo
This repo contains my solutions to the advent of code problems from 2015-2021. I have not solved every problem, but I am slowly working my way through them.
I have plans to write in other languages, hence why the current solutions are in the Python folder.
For a specific solution, go to `Python/year/day/` to find the python solution.

For the majority of problems, the python and data files are named `day.py` and `day.in` respectively, where `day` is the number of the day in the month.

To run a certain solution, `cd` into the desired directory and run with `python day.py day.in` where `day` is the respective number.
